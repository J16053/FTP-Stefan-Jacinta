Networks Project 1 - A Very Exciting Time Indeed

Building off the template code provided by Thomas at https://github.com/tpoetsch/concurrent_client_server, our FTP server accepts multiple client connections and allows users to log in using a username and password. The FTP client is designed to do a lot of the error checking so that commands sent to the server have the right number of parameters and are correctly formatted.
