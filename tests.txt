Test Cases
---

- USER username
  Currently, the server holds 4 users: STEFAN, JACINTA, YASIR, and THOMAS.
  These users were used to verify the correct function of the status change
  of the user. By default, once a client connects, it does not have an associated 
  user field and has status 1 i.e., connected. When a correct username is 
  sent to the server, the status is changed to 2 (i.e., username OK). Once 
  a correct password is provided through the 'PASS password' command, the status
  is changed to 2 (logged in). Then and only then will the user be able to perform
  and of the FTP / system commands to retrieve information from the server. 
  
- PASS password
  Each of the 4 aforementioned users have a corresponding password:
    JACINTA has password AWESOME.
    STEFAN has password SUPER.
    YASIR has password ZAKI.
    THOMAS has password POTSCH.
