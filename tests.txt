Test Cases
---

- USER username
  Currently, the server holds 4 users: STEFAN, JACINTA, YASIR, and THOMAS.
  These users were used to verify the correct function of the status change
  of the user. By default, once a client connects, it does not have an associated 
  user field and has status 1 i.e., connected. When a correct username is 
  sent to the server, the status is changed to 2 (i.e., username OK). Once 
  a correct password is provided through the 'PASS password' command, the status
  is changed to 3 (logged in). Then and only then will the user be able to perform
  any of the FTP / system commands to retrieve information from the server. 
 
	- USER valid_username
	[x] Server responds with "331 Username OK, need password"
	- USER invalid_username
	[x] Server responds with "430 Invalid username"
	- USER (no_username)
	[x] Request not sent to server, display "Please input username."  

- PASS password
  Each of the 4 aforementioned users have a corresponding password:
    JACINTA has password AWESOME.
    STEFAN has password SUPER.
    YASIR has password ZAKI.
    THOMAS has password POTSCH.
    
	- PASS valid_password
	[x] Server responds with "230 User logged in, proceed"
	- PASS invalid_password
	[x] Server responds with "430 Incorrect password"
	- PASS (no_password)
	[x] Request not sent to server, display "Please input password."
	- PASS password (username not OK)
	[x] Server responds with "530 User authentication is pending"

- PUT file
	Because the server and the client are often being run on the same machine during testing, be careful not to PUT a file to the same directory you are currently in: this may overwrite your original file.
	- PUT file (not logged in)
	[ ] Server responds with "530 User authentication is pending"
	- PUT file (not authenticated)
	[ ] Server responds with "530 Password authentication is pending"
	- PUT valid_file
	[x] File is sent to server and placed in server current directory: any existing file with the same name is overwritten
